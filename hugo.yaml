    content: |-
      I am a doctoral student at Waseda University's Graduate School of Creative Science and Engineering. My current research focuses on the development and industrialization of business digital transformation technologies for Japan's Society 5.0, funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). During my master's and doctoral studies, I have concentrated on integrating computer science-based research with industry to drive innovation and economic development. This is also the core topic of my doctoral research. Specifically, I am advancing the development of a smart retail system integrated with artificial intelligence technology, aimed at addressing labor shortages and the challenges posed by an aging population.
      
      I have interned at three leading Chinese internet companies including ByteDance and Tencent. My roles have ranged from algorithm engineer to game operations and strategy analysis. My personal research philosophy and life philosophy is: Innovation+Motivation=Application.
