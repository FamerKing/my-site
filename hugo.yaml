    content: |-
      I am a doctoral student at Waseda University's Graduate School of Creative Science and Engineering. My current research focuses on the development and industrialization of business digital transformation technologies for Japan's Society 5.0, funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). During my master's and doctoral studies, I have concentrated on integrating computer science-based research with industry to drive innovation and economic development. This is also the core topic of my doctoral research. Specifically, I am advancing the development of a smart retail system integrated with artificial intelligence technology, aimed at addressing labor shortages and the challenges posed by an aging population.
      
      I have interned at three leading Chinese internet companies including ByteDance and Tencent. My roles have ranged from algorithm engineer to game operations and strategy analysis. My personal research philosophy and life philosophy is: Innovation+Motivation=Application.

        content: A high-level makeup artist at zero cost for everyone! Makeup transfer is the process of applying the makeup style from one picture to another, allowing for the modification of characters' makeup styles. To meet the diverse makeup needs of individuals or samples, the makeup transfer framework should accurately handle various makeup degrees, ranging from subtle to bold, and exhibit intelligence in adapting to the source makeup. This paper introduces a "3-level" adaptive makeup transfer framework, addressing facial makeup through two sub-tasks. 1. Makeup adaptation, utilizing feature descriptors and eyelid curve algorithms to classify 135 organ-level face shapes; 2. Makeup transfer, achieved by learning the reference picture from three branches (color, highlight, pattern) and applying it to the source picture. Just imagine replicating Audrey Hepburn's makeup in 1 second!

      - title: Aspect-level cross-linguistic multi-layer sentiment analysis framework
        content: As an important epidemic prevention product, the sales of protective masks are increasing day by day. What are people's preferences for different types of masks? For example, do they care more about the protective function or comfort of the mask, or the brand? For example, does this tendency have anything to do with gender, local economy, and geographical location? Starting from this topic, we built a highly granular commodity sentiment computing framework that includes sentiment polarity, intensity, and advanced deep learning and economic modeling methods to try to accurately restore consumers' true attitudes.

      - title: AGO-I, A real-time consumer intelligent guidance system based on IoT and multi-tasking user portraits
        content: In the architecture of Society 5.0 actively promoted in Japan, the innovative retail industry is an essential component of the smart city, driving the high integration of network and physical space in the consumer industry. However, the AI facilities in various small and medium-sized stores in Japan are still at the level of some basic interactive applications. In order to improve the user's consumption experience and effectively promote the intelligence, customization and scientific management of the shopping system, we have designed a consumer intelligent guidance system based on deep learning and IoT technology. The system has two branches. 1. A high-granularity user profiling analysis framework; 2. A low-cost product management kit. Through this system, we can efficiently and accurately predict the age, gender, occupation and current physical state of consumers in real-time without infringing on personal privacy.
